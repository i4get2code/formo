# ~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just
# load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)

# .bashrc is only read by a shell
# that's both interactive and non-login,
# so lots of people end up telling
# their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc:

source ~/.profile
source ~/.bashrc
# [[ -r ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc
